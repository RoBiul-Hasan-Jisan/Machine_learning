F1-score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.

It balances the trade-off between precision and recall, especially for imbalanced datasets.



F1  =  2. Precision⋅Recal  / Precision + Recall

	​
Intuition

Precision → “Of all predicted positives, how many are correct?”

Recall → “Of all actual positives, how many did we catch?”

F1-score → combines both into one number to give overall performance for the positive class.

F1-score is high only if both precision and recall are high.


When to Use F1-Score

For imbalanced datasets where one class is rare

When both false positives and false negatives are important

Example:

Disease detection → want both high precision (few false alarms) and high recall (few missed cases)



F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It balances the trade-off between them and is especially useful for imbalanced datasets. A high F1-score means the model has both high precision and high recall.
