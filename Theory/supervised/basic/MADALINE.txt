MADALINE (Multiple ADALINEs)

Definition:

MADALINE is multiple ADALINE units combined in a network.

Usually has input layer → hidden layer → output layer.

Can solve some non-linear problems (still limited compared to modern MLPs).


Key Points:
Feature	             ADALINE                 	MADALINE
Architecture	     Single neuron	            Multi-layer network
Non-linear problem	 Cannot solve	            Can handle simple non-linear problems
Learning Rule	     LMS (Least Mean Squares)	Rule I / Rule II (error correction)


MADALINE Learning Rules:

Rule I: Change one hidden unit at a time to reduce error

Rule II: Modify output layer weights to reduce error

Early predecessor of modern neural networks


When to Use Them

ADALINE: Small, linearly separable datasets; when smoother learning is needed.

MADALINE: For problems that require more than one neuron, slightly more complex than ADALINE.

Mostly historical importance; now we use MLPs with ReLU/sigmoid instead.


MADALINE: Multiple ADALINE units, early network, can handle slightly non-linear problems.
