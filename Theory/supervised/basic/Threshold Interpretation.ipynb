    "What is a Threshold?\n",
    "A threshold is a cutoff value used to convert model outputs (probabilities, scores) into discrete class predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Binary Classification Example\n",
    "probabilities = model.predict_proba(X)[:, 1]  # [0.23, 0.67, 0.89, 0.45]\n",
    "threshold = 0.5\n",
    "predictions = (probabilities > threshold).astype(int)  # [0, 1, 1, 0]\n",
    "\n",

    "### Why Threshold Matters?\n",
    "Standard Threshold (0.5)\n",
    "Assumes equal cost of false positives and false negatives\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimal when class distribution is balanced\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Adjust Threshold:\n",
    "Medical diagnosis: Lower threshold (0.3) to catch more diseases\n",
    "\n",
    "Spam detection: Higher threshold (0.9) to avoid blocking important emails\n",
    "\n",
    "Fraud detection: Very low threshold (0.1) to catch all suspicious activity\n",
