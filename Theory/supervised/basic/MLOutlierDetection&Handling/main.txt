Z-Score (or Modified Z-Score – MAD)

 Best for: Normal distribution
 Easy, fast
 Main use in numeric features

Use when: data is mostly symmetric.



IQR Method (Boxplot Rule)

 Best for: skewed data
 Most common in real datasets
 Simple threshold:

Lower bound = Q1 – 1.5 × IQR

Upper bound = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR

Use when: dataset is not normal.






Isolation Forest (Most Used in ML)

 Works for big datasets
 Unsupervised
 Detects complicated outliers
 Very powerful

Use when:

You have mixed distributions

High-dimensional data




Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

 Good for density-based outliers
 Finds points in sparse regions

Use when: cluster-type data.



DBSCAN (Cluster + Noise Detection)

 Detects noise automatically
 Good for spatial / cluster datasets

Use when: you want clustering + outlier detection.




Winsorization / Capping (Handling)

 Instead of removing values, cap them
 Safer for ML models
 Very useful in finance & health data

Example:

Replace values > 99th percentile

Replace values < 1st percentile
