    "# Z-Score / Standard Deviation Method\n",
    " This method assumes your data follows a normal distribution (bell curve). It measures how many standard deviations each data point is away from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    " Z-score tells you how far a data point is from the mean, measured in standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    " If a value is too far from the mean, it’s considered an outlie\n",
    "\n",
    " Z = (x - μ) / σ\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "Z = Z-score (number of standard deviations from mean)\n",
    "\n",
    "x = individual data point\n",
    "\n",
    "μ = mean of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "σ = standard deviation of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outlier Detection Rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "If |Z| > 3, the point is considered an outlier\n",

    "So only 0.3% of points should naturally fall beyond 3 standard deviations\n",
