What is Underfitting?

Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern in the data.

Result: poor performance on both training and test data.

Intuition

Imagine fitting a curve to some data points:

Underfitting: A straight line tries to fit a complex curve → misses trends → high bias

Good Fit: The curve captures the pattern → generalizes well

Overfitting: The curve passes through all points → memorizes data → high variance

Think: “The model doesn’t learn enough from the data.”


Causes of Underfitting

Model is too simple (not enough parameters)

Not enough training (too few epochs)

Features do not capture complex relationships

Too much regularization


How to Detect Underfitting

Low accuracy on both training and test sets

Model cannot capture obvious patterns in data


Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the data’s underlying pattern, leading to poor performance on both training and test sets. It can be fixed by using a more complex model, adding features, reducing regularization, or training longer.
