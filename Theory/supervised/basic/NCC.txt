What is it?

NCC is a simple supervised classification algorithm.

It classifies a sample based on distance to the “centroid” (mean) of each class.

Works best for well-separated, small to medium datasets.



Simple and fast, low computational cost

Works well when classes are spherical and equally sized

Sensitive to outliers (centroid shifts)

Usually Euclidean distance is used, but other distances (Manhattan, Mahalanobis) can work


Easy to implement

Very interpretable

Requires no training iteration like gradient descent


disADV
Assumes linearly separable clusters

Sensitive to non-spherical distributions

Not good with overlapping classes

Iris Dataset: Each species has a mean feature vector (centroid).

Handwritten digits (MNIST): Simple baseline classifier using centroid of each digit.


Nearest Centroid Classifier is a supervised algorithm that classifies a sample based on its distance to the mean (centroid) of each class. It is simple, interpretable, and works well for small, well-separated datasets. The model computes centroids during training and assigns new points to the nearest one using a distance metric like Euclidean distance
