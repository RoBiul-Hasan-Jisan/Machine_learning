What is Overfitting?

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and random fluctuations, rather than just the underlying pattern.

Result: high accuracy on training data, poor accuracy on new/unseen data.

Intuition

Imagine you’re trying to fit a curve to some data points:

Underfitting: The curve is too simple, misses trends → high bias

Overfitting: The curve is too wiggly, goes through every point → high variance

Think: “The model memorized the data instead of learning the pattern.”


Causes of Overfitting

Model is too complex (too many parameters)

Small training dataset

Too many training epochs (for neural networks)

No proper regularization


ow to Detect Overfitting

Training accuracy very high, test accuracy much lower

Validation loss increases while training loss keeps decreasing



Overfitting happens when a model learns the training data too well, including noise, leading to poor generalization on new data. It is often caused by overly complex models, small datasets, or excessive training. Techniques like regularization, early stopping, and increasing data help prevent it.
