    "# Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a statistical model used for **binary classification** (can be extended to multi-class). It predicts the **probability** that an instance belongs to a particular class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its name, it is a **classification algorithm**, not regression. The \"regression\" part refers to using a regression-like approach to estimate probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Core Mathematical Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logit Function (Log-Odds)\n",
    "The \"Logit\" is the natural log of the odds ratio. It maps probability values from $(0, 1)$ to $(-\\infty, +\\infty)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{logit}(p) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\dots + \\beta_n x_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **$p$:** Probability of success (class = 1)\n",
    "* **$1-p$:** Probability of failure (class = 0)\n",
    "* **$\\ln(\\frac{p}{1-p})$:** Log-odds\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sigmoid Function\n",
    "The Sigmoid function maps the output of the linear equation ($z$) back to a probability range $(0, 1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p = \\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Where:** $z = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\dots + \\beta_n x_n$\n",
    "* **Properties:**\n",
    "    * **Output range:** $(0, 1)$\n",
    "    * **Shape:** S-shaped curve\n",
    "    * **Derivative:** $\\sigma'(z) = \\sigma(z)(1-\\sigma(z))$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Assumptions of Logistic Regression\n",
    "* **Binary Outcome:** The target variable is binary (for standard logistic regression).\n",
    "* **Linearity of Log-Odds:** There is a linear relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of the target.\n",
    "* **No Multicollinearity:** Independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "* **Independence:** Observations must be independent of each other.\n",
    "* **Large Sample Size:** Rule of thumb is at least 10 events per predictor variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Cost Function & Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cost Function: Cross-Entropy Loss (Log Loss)\n",
    "We cannot use Mean Squared Error (MSE) because it creates a non-convex loss surface (many local minima). Instead, we use **Cross-Entropy**, which is convex.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left[ y^{(i)} \\log(h_\\theta(x^{(i)})) + (1-y^{(i)}) \\log(1-h_\\theta(x^{(i)})) \\right]$$\n",

    "* $h_\\theta(x)$: Predicted probability\n",
    "* $y$: Actual label (0 or 1)\n",
    "* $m$: Number of samples\n",

    "#### Optimization: Gradient Descent\n",
    "We minimize the Cost Function using Gradient Descent or solvers like `liblinear`/`lbfgs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Update Rule:**\n",
    "$$\\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial J(\\theta)}{\\partial \\theta_j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Calculation:**\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial J(\\theta)}{\\partial \\theta_j} = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) x_j^{(i)}$$\n",

    "* **Specificity:** $\\frac{TN}{TN+FP}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Probability & Calibration Metrics\n",
    "* **Log Loss:** Measures the uncertainty/quality of predicted probabilities.\n",
    "* **ROC-AUC:** Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes.\n",
    "* **Precision-Recall AUC:** Better for highly imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Threshold Selection\n",
    "Default threshold is **0.5**, but it should be tuned based on business needs:\n",
    "* Use **ROC Curve** to find the optimal balance.\n",
    "* Use **Youden's J statistic:** $J = \\text{Sensitivity} + \\text{Specificity} - 1$.\n",
    "* Consider the **Business Cost** of False Positives vs. False Negatives.\n",

    "### 5. Regularization (Preventing Overfitting)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### L1 Regularization (Lasso)\n",
    "Adds the absolute value of magnitude of coefficients as a penalty term.\n",
    "$$J(\\theta) = \\text{CrossEntropy} + \\lambda \\sum |\\theta_j|$$\n",
    "* **Effect:** Creates **sparse models** (Feature Selection). Can zero out coefficients entirely.\n",

    "#### L2 Regularization (Ridge)\n",
    "Adds the squared magnitude of coefficients as a penalty term.\n",
    "$$J(\\theta) = \\text{CrossEntropy} + \\lambda \\sum \\theta_j^2$$\n",
    "* **Effect:** Shrinks coefficients toward zero (but not exactly zero). Handles multicollinearity better.\n",

    "#### Elastic Net\n",
    "* A linear combination of **L1** and **L2** regularization.\n",

    "### 6. Multiclass Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **One-vs-Rest (OvR):** Trains $k$ binary classifiers (e.g., Red vs. Not Red, Blue vs. Not Blue).\n",
    "2.  **Multinomial (Softmax) Regression:** Direct generalization using the Softmax function.\n",
    "    $$P(y=k|x) = \\frac{e^{\\theta_k \\cdot x}}{\\sum_{j} e^{\\theta_j \\cdot x}}$$\n",

    "* **P-values:** Used to determine statistical significance of features.\n",
    "* **Confidence Intervals:** Defines the range for odds ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Practical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling Categorical Variables\n",
    "* Use **One-Hot Encoding** (Dummy Variables).\n",
    "* **Avoid Dummy Variable Trap:** Drop one category (k-1 dummies) to prevent perfect multicollinearity.\n",
    "* Use **Target/Mean Encoding** for high-cardinality features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Scaling\n",
    "* **Not strictly required** for the core logic (unlike KNN).\n",
    "* **Highly Recommended** because:\n",
    "    1.  It helps Gradient Descent converge much faster.\n",
    "    2.  It is **Mandatory** if you are using Regularization (L1/L2), otherwise larger features will be penalized unfairly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checking Assumptions\n",
    "* **Linearity:** Use Box-Tidwell test or residual plots.\n",
    "* **Influential Points:** Check Cook's Distance.\n",
    "* **Multicollinearity:** Check VIF (Variance Inflation Factor).\n",
