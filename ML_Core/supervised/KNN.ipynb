    "# KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN is a **supervised**, **instance-based** (lazy learner), and **non-parametric** algorithm used for classification and regression. It makes predictions by finding the $k$ closest data points (neighbors) in the training set to a new input and using a majority vote (classification) or an average (regression) of their values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Steps\n",
    "The core steps for making a prediction on a new data point are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Calculate Distance:** Measure the distance (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan) from the new point to all points in the training set.\n",
    "2.  **Find Neighbors:** Identify the $k$ points with the smallest distances.\n",
    "3.  **Aggregate for Output:**\n",
    "    * **For Classification:** Assign the most common class among the $k$ neighbors.\n",
    "    * **For Regression:** Assign the average value of the $k$ neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Critical Parameters and Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "The performance of KNN hinges on several key decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Choosing 'k' (Number of Neighbors)\n",
    "This is the most critical parameter.\n",
    "* **Small $k$ (e.g., 1):** Makes the model sensitive to noise (overfitting).\n",
    "* **Large $k$:** Oversimplifies the model (underfitting).\n",
    "* **Tip:** An **odd** $k$ value is preferred for classification to avoid ties. The optimal $k$ is data-dependent and is typically found using cross-validation or the Elbow Method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Selecting a Distance Metric\n",
    "The choice defines \"closeness.\" Common metrics include:\n",
    "* **Euclidean Distance:** The straight-line distance (default for continuous features).\n",
    "* **Manhattan Distance:** Sum of absolute differences (useful for grid-like data).\n",
    "* **Minkowski Distance:** A generalized formula; setting $p=2$ gives Euclidean, $p=1$ gives Manhattan.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Other Tuning Parameters\n",
    "* **Weights:** Neighbors can be weighted uniformly or by the inverse of their distance (`weights='distance'`), giving closer points more influence.\n",
    "* **Algorithm:** Methods like `ball_tree` or `kd_tree` can be faster than `brute` force for larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Best Practice:** Use `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` from scikit-learn to systematically test combinations of these parameters (e.g., `n_neighbors`, `weights`, `metric`) and find the best set via cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use (and When to Avoid)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Use KNN when... | Avoid KNN when... |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| You have a small to moderately sized dataset. | The dataset is very large (slow prediction). |\n",
    "| Interpretability is important (explaining \"nearest neighbors\" is intuitive). | The dataset has many features (high-dimensional). |\n",
    "| Data has a non-linear pattern and you need a simple baseline model. | Prediction speed is a critical requirement. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Applications\n",
    "Due to its intuitive logic, KNN is widely used in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recommendation Systems:** Finding users with similar tastes to suggest products or content.\n",
    "* **Pattern Recognition & Security:** Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions by identifying anomalous patterns.\n",
    "* **Healthcare:** Classifying medical diagnoses, such as predicting the risk of a disease based on similar patient records.\n",
    "* **Finance:** Credit scoring, stock market forecasting, and customer profiling."

    "# KNN: Classifier vs. Regressor\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like Decision Trees, the KNN algorithm adapts based on whether your target variable is a **Category** (Label) or a **Number** (Value).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. KNN Classifier\n",
    "**Use this when:** Your target variable is **Categorical**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Logic:** \"Majority Vote.\" The algorithm looks at the $k$ nearest neighbors and assigns the class that appears most frequently.\n",
    "* **Tie-Breaking:** If there is a tie (e.g., 2 neighbors are Red, 2 are Blue), it often selects the class of the *closest* neighbor (if weights are used) or the first one found.\n",
    "* **Output:** A Class Label (e.g., \"Malignant\", \"Spam\", \"Blue\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "* If $k=3$ and the neighbors are [Red, Red, Blue], the prediction is **Red**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. KNN Regressor\n",
    "**Use this when:** Your target variable is **Continuous**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Logic:** \"Average.\" The algorithm looks at the $k$ nearest neighbors and calculates the mean (average) of their values.\n",
    "* **Output:** A Numerical Value (e.g., 150.5, $250k, 32°C).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "* If $k=3$ and the neighbor values are [10, 20, 30], the prediction is **20** (since $(10+20+30)/3 = 20$).\n",
