    "# Elastic Net Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Elastic Net** is a hybrid regularization technique that combines the penalties of **Lasso (L1)** and **Ridge (L2)** methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is designed to solve specific limitations of Lasso and Ridge, offering the \"best of both worlds\": **Feature Selection** (from Lasso) and **Stability** (from Ridge).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concept\n",
    "$$\\text{Elastic Net} = \\text{L1 (Lasso)} + \\text{L2 (Ridge)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is particularly useful when:\n",
    "* **Lasso alone is unstable** (e.g., highly correlated features).\n",
    "* **Ridge alone is not enough** (you need to eliminate useless features).\n",
    "* **Features are highly correlated.**\n",
    "* You want both **shrinkage** (coefficient reduction) and **feature selection** (setting coefficients to zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The Mathematical Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net adds both L1 and L2 penalties to the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) cost function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "J(\\beta) = \\underbrace{\\text{MSE}}_{\\text{Error}} + \\underbrace{\\lambda_1 \\sum_{j=1}^{p} |\\beta_j|}_{\\text{L1 Penalty}} + \\underbrace{\\lambda_2 \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_j^2}_{\\text{L2 Penalty}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `sklearn` Implementation\n",
    "In Python's `scikit-learn`, the formula is slightly parameterized using `alpha` (total strength) and `l1_ratio` (mix percentage):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Loss = \\text{MSE} + \\alpha \\left( \\rho \\sum |\\beta| + \\frac{(1-\\rho)}{2} \\sum \\beta^2 \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **$\\alpha$ (alpha):** Controls the overall strength of regularization.\n",
    "* **$\\rho$ (`l1_ratio`):** Controls the balance between L1 and L2.\n",
    "    * If `l1_ratio = 1` $\\rightarrow$ Pure Lasso.\n",
    "    * If `l1_ratio = 0` $\\rightarrow$ Pure Ridge.\n",
    "    * If `0 < l1_ratio < 1` $\\rightarrow$ Elastic Net.\n",

    "## 2. Why Elastic Net? (The \"Grouping Effect\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most critical reason to use Elastic Net over Lasso.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem with Lasso\n",
    "When features are **highly correlated** (e.g., Feature A and Feature B have 0.99 correlation):\n",
    "* **Lasso** tends to pick just **one** feature arbitrarily and sets the other to zero.\n",
    "* This causes **instability** (small data changes result in different features being selected).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Elastic Net Solution\n",
    "Elastic Net fixes this using the L2 term.\n",
    "* It creates a **Grouping Effect**: It tends to select groups of correlated features together rather than picking just one.\n",
    "* It keeps the feature selection capability (setting some coefficients to exactly zero) but is more rigorous in what it keeps.\n",

    "## 3. When Should You Use Elastic Net?\n",
    "\n",
    "| Scenario | Recommendation |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Highly Correlated Features** | **YES.** Essential for stability (avoids random selection). |\n",
    "| **High Dimensions ($p > n$)** | **YES.** Works better than Lasso when features > samples. |\n",
    "| **Need Feature Selection** | **YES.** It will zero out irrelevant features. |\n",
    "| **Unsure between Lasso/Ridge** | **YES.** Just tune `l1_ratio`. It's the safe middle ground. |\n",

    "| Method | Penalty | Feature Selection? | Handles Correlated Data? |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Ridge** | L2 ($\\beta^2$) | No (Coefficients $\\to$ small, not 0) | Yes (Shrinks them together) |\n",
    "| **Lasso** | L1 ($|\\beta|$) | **Yes** (Coefficients $\\to$ 0) | **No** (Picks 1, drops others) |\n",
    "| **Elastic Net** | **L1 + L2** | **Yes** | **Yes** (Selects groups) |"
