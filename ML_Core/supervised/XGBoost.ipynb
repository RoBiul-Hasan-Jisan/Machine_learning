    "# XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost stands for **eXtreme Gradient Boosting**.\n",
    "* **Gradient Boosting:** It belongs to the family of ensemble learning methods, specifically using the Gradient Boosting framework.\n",
    "* **Ensemble Learning:** The core idea is to combine multiple \"weak learners\" (typically decision trees) to create a single \"strong learner.\" The model \"learns\" from its previous mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analogy: The Student Learning from Mistakes\n",
    "Imagine a student preparing for an exam:\n",
    "1.  **First Try (Tree 1):** The student takes a practice test and gets a score. They analyze their mistakes.\n",
    "2.  **Second Try (Tree 2):** They focus *specifically* on the topics they got wrong in the first test.\n",
    "3.  **Repeat (Subsequent Trees):** They keep taking new tests, each time paying extra attention to the errors made in the previous test.\n",
    "4.  **Final Exam (Prediction):** For the final exam, the student's knowledge is the sum of all the incremental learning from each practice test.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it Works: Step-by-Step\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The High-Level Idea: Sequential Ensemble\n",
    "Unlike Random Forest which builds trees in parallel, XGBoost builds trees **sequentially**. Each new tree is trained to correct the residual errors made by the combination of all previous trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a) The Model\n",
    "The final prediction for a data point $i$ after $K$ trees is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y}_i = \\phi(x_i) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} f_k(x_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\hat{y}_i$: Final predicted value.\n",
    "* $x_i$: Feature vector for data point $i$.\n",
    "* $f_k$: The prediction from the $k$-th decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) The Objective Function\n",
    "This is the heart of XGBoost. The goal is to minimize:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Obj(\\theta) = \\sum_i L(y_i, \\hat{y}_i) + \\sum_k \\Omega(f_k)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This function has two critical parts:\n",
    "1.  **Training Loss ($L$):** Measures how well our model fits the training data (e.g., Squared Error $(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$).\n",
    "2.  **Regularization Term ($\\Omega$):** Penalizes model complexity to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "    $$\\Omega(f) = \\gamma T + \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda ||w||^2$$\n",
    "    * $T$: Number of leaves in the tree.\n",
    "    * $w$: The score (prediction value) on each leaf.\n",
    "    * $\\gamma$ (gamma): Minimum loss reduction required to make a split.\n",
    "    * $\\lambda$ (lambda): L2 regularization term on leaf weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The Learning Process: Additive Training\n",
    "We start with an initial prediction (e.g., mean value).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 0:** $\\hat{y}_i^{(0)} = 0$\n",
    "* **Step 1:** Build tree $f_1$ to minimize the objective. $\\hat{y}_i^{(1)} = \\hat{y}_i^{(0)} + f_1(x_i)$\n",
    "* **Step t:** Add tree $f_t$ that improves the model the most.\n",
    "    $$\\hat{y}_i^{(t)} = \\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)} + f_t(x_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How is the Next Tree Built? (Gradient Boosting)\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **Gradient Descent** in function space. We don't have parameters like weights in a neural network; our \"parameters\" are the trees themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Compute Gradients:**\n",
    "For a given loss function (e.g., Squared Loss), we calculate the gradient ($g_i$) and Hessian ($h_i$) for each data point with respect to the previous prediction.\n",
    "* $g_i = \\partial L / \\partial \\hat{y} = -2(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)$ (First derivative)\n",
    "* $h_i = \\partial^2 L / \\partial \\hat{y}^2 = 2$ (Second derivative)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Find Optimal Leaf Weights:**\n",
    "Once the tree structure is fixed, the optimal weight $w_j^*$ for leaf $j$ is calculated analytically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w_j^* = - \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in I_j} g_i}{\\sum_{i \\in I_j} h_i + \\lambda}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Calculate the Objective Reduction (The \"Gain\"):**\n",
    "The algorithm decides where to split the tree by maximizing this **Gain** formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Gain = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{(\\sum_{L} g_i)^2}{\\sum_{L} h_i + \\lambda} + \\frac{(\\sum_{R} g_i)^2}{\\sum_{R} h_i + \\lambda} - \\frac{(\\sum_{P} g_i)^2}{\\sum_{P} h_i + \\lambda} \\right] - \\gamma$$\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Insight:** Notice the $-\\gamma$ at the end. This means the split must improve the loss by at least $\\gamma$ to be considered valid. This is XGBoost's built-in pruning mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
